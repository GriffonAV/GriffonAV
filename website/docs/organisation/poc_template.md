# Context

Why are we making this poc ?
It can be for technical reason like is this approach better than another one or is this tool better than this one ?
Or it can be related to technological watch, for example : I saw this post about this new rust feature and wanted to test it to see if it could be integrated in our project.
Or it could to learn something, for example I want to learn the basic of rust and I do a tic-tac-toe project.

# Objective

Clearly define the objectives of the poc, they are usualy divided in two categories :
1. what feature do I want this poc to have ?
2. what question do I want to answer (ex: can this be used in the project, is A better than B, ...) ?

# Time-Frame

How long should this poc be and why ?  
It is important to try and stick to the timeframe, because time can be a reason why we are or not using a tool or technology.  
  
some guidelines you could follow:  
> Technological watch   
> 1-2 hours coding  
> 30 minutes report  

> tool testing  
> 1-2 hours per tool  
> 45 minutes comparative report  

> learning  
> 1 hours  
> 20 minutes report (it's important to divide learning into concepts and maybe multiples poc)

> testing a new approach  
> 2-3 hours  
> 30 minutes report     

# Results

### What did I manage to do in the time frame I had ?

can be presented as a list of feature if it was defined well in the `objective` category

example :  
<span style="color:lightgreen;">- Task 1 </span>  
<span style="color:orange;">- Task 2 </span>  
<span style="color:red;">- Task 3 </span>

### What answer did I get

describe what you discovered possibly answering the question you had made in the `objective` category
can this be used in the project ?

### Follow-up

what are we gonna do with what we learned here ?
1. Not really usefull, we drop it
2. Unravelled more question, we should make another poc to answer those
3. Really usefull, we might try to implement it in the project > open a new issue in the project
